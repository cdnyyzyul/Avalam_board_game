# Avalam_board_game

Avalam is a two-player game with win, null and loss conditions- a zero-sum game. Like most adversarial agents, we need to understand key aspects of the game to build an agent:
- Initial state - The initial state of the board has opposing color pawns arranged diagonally.

- Viable actions - Pawns can be stacked on to adjacent pawns but it is illegal to stack more than 5 pawns.
- Every Avalam player can move his/her opponentâ€™s pawns.
- Terminal state - The game ends when no legal moves are allowed.
